    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is appraisal in an insurance claim?</summary>
      <p>When you and your insurance company can‚Äôt agree on the amount of loss, each side selects an independent appraiser. These appraisers review the claim, gather evidence, and, if needed, involve a neutral umpire to make the final decision. The process is designed to be fair, impartial, and faster than litigation‚Äîhelping you reach a binding settlement based on industry standards and documented facts.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does appraisal decide coverage?</summary>
      <p>No‚Äîappraisal determines how much the loss is, not whether it‚Äôs covered. If there‚Äôs a dispute about coverage, involve a licensed public adjuster prior to invoking appraisal. A public adjuster can evaluate your policy, inspect the damage, and determine whether the loss qualifies as a covered loss under your policy.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take?</summary>
      <p>It varies by claim complexity and scheduling, but the structured process helps move claims forward faster than open-ended negotiations.</p>
    </details>
