  <h2>Why Appraisal?</h2>
  <p><strong>Every project is unique.</strong><br><br>
  Materials, installation method, and workmanship standards can vary widely from one project to another. Estimating a loss isn’t an exact science — even with standardized estimating tools, two professionals might arrive at different conclusions about what it takes to restore a property to its prior condition.</p>

  <p><strong>Differences in estimates are inevitable.</strong><br><br>
  Adjusters and contractors often interpret damage, scope, and repair methods differently. They may disagree on what’s affected, what it takes to fix it, or what it should cost — not out of bias, but because they approach the problem from different angles.</p>

  <p><strong>AppraSure's Role.</strong><br><br>
  AppraSure implements a structured, fair, and neutral process for resolving disputes about cost and scope. Our goal is to efficiently reach a resolution and avoid unnecessary delays in claim settlement. Our team is fluent in both restorative construction and estimating. We bring clarity to complex claims and strive to reach a fair, evidence-based resolution.</p>
