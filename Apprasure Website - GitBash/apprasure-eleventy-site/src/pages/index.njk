    <h2>How the Appraisal Process Works</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Appraisal is a structured way to resolve disagreements about the cost to repair or replace property after an insured loss.
      Here‚Äôs how we keep it simple and fair:

    <div class="steps">
      <article class="step">
        <div class="icon" aria-hidden="true">üîé</div>
        <h3>1) Identify the Dispute</h3>
        <p>You and your insurer disagree on scope or price. Appraisal focuses on the <em>amount of loss</em>‚Äîthat‚Äôs it.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <div class="icon" aria-hidden="true">üìã</div>
        <h3>2) Each Side Picks an Appraiser</h3>
        <p>Both parties select a qualified appraiser. We act as your independent expert to evaluate scope and pricing.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <div class="icon" aria-hidden="true">ü§ù</div>
        <h3>3) Agree or Go to an Umpire</h3>
        <p>Appraisers compare findings. If they can‚Äôt agree, a neutral umpire is chosen to make the final call.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <div class="icon" aria-hidden="true">‚öñÔ∏è</div>
        <h3>4) Binding Award</h3>
        <p>The final award sets the <em>amount of loss</em>. This helps move your claim toward resolution.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is appraisal in an insurance claim?</summary>
      <p>It‚Äôs a contractual process (in many policies) to resolve disagreements about the amount of loss. Each side picks an appraiser; if they can‚Äôt agree, an umpire decides.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does appraisal decide coverage?</summary>
      <p>No. Appraisal determines <em>how much</em> the loss is, not whether it‚Äôs covered.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take?</summary>
      <p>It varies by claim complexity and scheduling, but the structured process helps move claims forward faster than open-ended negotiations.</p>
    </details>
